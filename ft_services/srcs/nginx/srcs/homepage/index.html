        <h1>About This Website</h1>
            <p>This is my first website, and I decided to make 
                it about something I absolutely love! Recently 
                I discovered a clothing brand that really connected 
                to me. This is a sports wear brand called Arms of Andes 
                which is made out of alpaca wool! As you can probably already tell
                from the image above I really love alpacas (and lamas)!
                In what follows I will discuss what I was looking for in 
                a clothing brand and how Arms of Andes fulfilled these criterias
                and many many more. I hope you will find it as interesting as I do 
                and enjoy the pictures of alpacas (and some lamas because why not).
                Please feel free to leave some.

                <p>For my whole life I have been searching for the perfect clothing 
                brand and I think I have finally found it. Funnily enough I also LOVE
                alpacas and when making alpaca clothing they are treated like queens!
                So I couldn't imagine anything better</p>
