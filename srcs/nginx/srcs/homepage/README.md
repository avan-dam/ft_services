My Website is all about my favourite clothing brand. This is an alpaca clothing brand called Arms of andes. The first page gives an overview of my website. There are additional pages on why I love alpaca clothing and a gallery of the clothing they provide. Furthermore, you can find a quiz on whether images are of an alpaca or a llama! There is also a feedback page.
