    <h1>Why alpaca clothing!</h1>
	 <h3>The benefits of alpaca clothing:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The clothes are super soft, sometimes I even sleep in them 
				because they are just so comfy I never want to take them off!</li>
			<li>I can workout in them and go hiking and
				it wicks away the sweat. You don't even need to wash them because they are 
			   odor resitant.</li>
			<li>Feeling a bit bloated? No worries they are also stretchy!</li>
			<li>I have had my items from a long time and they still look 
				really good because of their durable knit.</li>
			<li>We all know the environment is something we need to 
				look after but sometimes its hard to find clothing 
				that is both sustainable and looks good! Well this is both
				as it is biodegradable.</li>
			<li>Also it will stop you overheating because it is a natural 
				temperature regulator</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Can you tell which ones of these are alpacas and which ones are llamas?</h3>
